NASAaccess - Tethys is a software application in the form of a [tethys](https://www.tethysplatform.org/) web application. [NASAaccess](https://github.com/nasa/NASAaccess) software can generate gridded ascii tables of climate [CMIP5](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/ "Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5"), [CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/ "Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6") and weather data ([GPM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/directory "Global Precipitation Measurement"), [TRMM](https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm "Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission"), [GLDAS](https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas "Global Land Data Assimilation System")) needed to drive various hydrological models (e.g., [SWAT](https://swat.tamu.edu/ "Soil & Water Assessment Tool"), [VIC](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC "Variable Infiltration Capacity"), [RHESSys](https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys "The Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System") â€¦etc).
